   “Nash Homes, who were trusted with the sale and conveyance of our property at Las Terrazzas, Portals Nous were
    found to be most professional. From the time the fee was negotiated until completion, my wife and I received politeness
    and consideration from all their staff. The property was suitably advertised, the deed was checked for accuracy and we
    were kept informed on the progress. When a suitable sale was agreed, all procedures were undertaken by Nash Homes,
    all my wife had to do was turn up at the Notary's office on a date agreed. They also arranged the removal of sundries to
    the UK and hotel accommodation on sale completion. Thank you for a job well done, it certainly removed some of the
    stress connected with property disposal in Spain. Yours truly, Ray Smith.”</em></p>

         They were extremely professional, helpful, courteous and understanding. At all times I felt they were looking after my best interests and I felt
         I was in safe hands.’ I would have no hesitation in using them for future property acquisitions, rentals and sales.”</em> </p>

        realise the value of your excellent staff, their willingness to help out even in the smallest details and their language
        skills – I think you have the mix just right! Best wishes, Dr Barry Abrahams”</em></p>

       <p><em>  “Nash Homes Mallorca sold our property in Portals Nous in only 8 weeks. Gave us excellent service and advised us
        professionally though the completion. Jacqui handled a minor price reduction on the property very professionally and represented
        us as a seller though the tough negotiations with the buyers. All in all she left the buyers and sellers in a win-win situation in a tough market situation.”</em></p>

      <p><em>   “I would like to thank you and your company very much for the quick sale of my apartment last month especially in this market.
        Also you made the sale very smooth for me by organizing everything, including the removal company to collect, as I was not there
        in Mallorca. And also I would like to thank you for saving me money on my legal fees by going through the notary that you recommended.
        All in all, it was one of the smoothest sales of a property I have had. Considering I had the property on the market with you for only one
        month and you had many viewings which goes to show you obviously had the right clientele and I therefore would be recommending you
        and your company to any of my friends or associates that are looking to buy or sell in the future. Thank you once again for all your help.”</em></p>

       – once again – buying is easy – but selling – you need the best agent with the best contacts and the best knowledge of the market!
       And you are it! Best regards, Kay, John and Adam Harris, Bendinat Golf”
“We have worked with Nash Homes for probably 4/5 years, they are professional and efficient. During that time through their offices we
have rented an apartment out continuously which they have managed on our behalf. We would not choose to work with any other
property management agency on the island.”</em></p>
