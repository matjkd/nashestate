h1. Ignite Estates Version 0.0.1(development)

This is built on codeigniter 1.7.2, I've removed the database file for security reasons, but you should be able to copy all files over a codeigniter install. 
The config file will need changing to suit your setup.

When it's nearer a workable state I'll add a SQL file with the database info. Then eventually an installer folder

Currently in very early stages right now so don't even try to install it yet unless you wish to contribute or don't mind using a system that doesn't work!
