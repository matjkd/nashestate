h1. Ignite Estates Version 0.0.1(development)

This is built on codeigniter 1.7.2, I've removed the database file for security reasons.

When it's nearer a workable state I'll add a SQL file with the database info. Then eventually an installer folder

Currently in very early stages right now so don't even try to install it yet unless you wish to contribute or don't mind using a system that doesn't work!

h2. Description

Ignite Estates is a CMS for Estate Agents using the Codeigniter PHP framework. The main purpose is to create a fully functional Estate Agent website that is simple to use. 
Initially it is being built for some very specific requirements, though the long term goal is flexibility.
